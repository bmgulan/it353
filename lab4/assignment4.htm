	<li><h3>Taking IT Ethics Seriously</h3></li>
	<ul>
		<li>This article took a look at some of the ethical downsides that can arise the advancement and scope of technology.  Some of these issues include a digital divide, loss of human control and oversight, and substitution of human labor.
			The digital divide refers to the seperation of people that arises from technology.  This can occur not only because there are physical limitations preventing a person from accessing technology, such money or infrastructure, but also 
			because of the lack of knowledge.  The example provided in the article was about how one woman was scared that she was doing things illegally using the internet, however, she did not have the experience and understanding that it was
			just a virus trying to take advantage of her.  As a software developer, I believe it is my duty to make technology widely available to everyone, and to greatly increase the amount of technological education to everyone to help decrease
			this gap.  Another ethical problem was the loss of human control.  While this may seem like a sci-fi problem, with more data being stored in cloud networks, it is our job to make sure that the people using the service's data is secure.
			The last issue was the substitution of human labor, which could ultimately lead to permanent unemployment.  While most companies see the inclusion of technology as a way to save time and money, it does come at a cost, and this is generally
			due to someone losing a job.  The article states one way to combat this ethical issue is for every job lost because of technology, we should try to create a new one to take it's place.</li>
