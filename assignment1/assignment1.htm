			<h3>Google Agitates for Revolution</h3>
			<p align="left">This article discussed Web components and their future involvement in the web. Web components are a W3C standard designed to help organize complex Web pages by providing a mechanism to assemble them using small single-function components. The advantage of using web components is that it allows developers to compartmentalize their problems when creating web pages. The article then discussed Polymer, which is Google's library to use and extend web components. To take advantage of this technology, web developers can embbed all the libraries elements, and dependencies within a web component. Then while using the import html tag, the component can be used, and then reused again in the future. This also allows developers to use components written by others, promoting code reusability. </p>

			<h3>Enterprise Tech in 2014</h3>
			<p align="left"> This article discussed the 14 enterprise technologies to look for in 2014. The list included a wide range of both hardware and software technologies, varying from 3D printers to cloud computing to social business.  Some of the more interesting technologies mentioned include Internet of Things (IoT), the Quantified Enterprise, and global solutions networks. IoT discusses how all sorts of products will soon be network connected. The Quantified Enterprise is about how using big data analytics will lead to everything that can be measured will be measured.  This will allow for better business insights and understanding. Global solutions networks allow companies to utilize digital communities and mass collaboration to tackle large problems. </p>

			<h3>Mashups, the new breed of Web App</h3>
			<p align="left">This article discusses the growing popularity of web applications called mashups.  It makes a good analogy to pop music, where a new song is mixed from the vocal and instrumental tracks of two different source songs. Like the songs, mashup sites take third party data and combine them to create intuitive applications that can display data in a meaningful way. One example is ChicagoCrime.org, which takes the Chicago Crime database and displays the geolocation on top of a Google map.  There are several different breeds of mashup applications. Mapping mashups take the large amount of data being collected with geolcations to be mapped visually using mainly Google Map's API.  Other mashup breeds include video and photo, search and shopping, and news mashups.  The article then discusses some of the technologies required to make mashups possible.  There needs to be a content provider or API, the actual site, and then the clients web browser. In addition, Ajax makes these dynamically loading web pages possible. As mashups become more popular, it will be interesting to see the affects it has on our society with the ability to visualize almost any type of data in real time. </p>

			<h3>Dirty Little Secrets of Search</h3>
			<p align="left"> This article is on a topic that is very interesting and very important to businesses wanting to have an online presence.  It discusses how JC Penney was the highest search result on Google for a wide range of topics; sometimes, Penney even came up higher than the actual manufacturer of the product it sells.  Although JC Penney claims they did not have anything to do with this, whoever did took advantage of part of Google's ranking algorithm. It is only a single factor in rank, but as other sites link to your own, your search ranking increases.  The New York Times disovered that JC Penney had 2015 different pages linking to their site based on a variety of different topics.  This increased their ranking and allowed them to be number one.  However, this is gaming the system and not allowing the sites to organically rise to the top. So, Google takes action and decreases the rank of the violating site when this happens.  This could essentially bury a company if their organic results are not very high.  This article is a little dated, however, because I believe now Google has a more sophisticated way to detecting if a site is gaming their search results and does not display them as highly.  </p>

			<h3>Man Who Wants to Translate Web</h3>
			<p align="left">This article discussed a new tool called Duolingo, created by Luis von Ahn and Severin Hacker.  The article states that 50% of the world's web pages are in English; this poses a problem for countries with a developing internet presence.  The goal of Duolingo is to tranlate every web page into every language. However, this is quite a daunting task both in the cost, as well as the sheer amount of people and time required to do this. To overcome this problem, Duolingo is taking advantage of people wanting to learn a new language. In this language training course, Duolingo has many individuals translate sentences from real web pages. It then takes the best translation, and uses that on its translated page. This way it ensures that it gets the best translation, as well as keeping the software to learn a new language 100% free. </p>

			<h3>Google Will Search Before You Ask</h3>
			<p align="left"> This article had to do with a vision of the future that Google CEO Eric Schmidt has.  It has to do with google providing search information to you in real time before you even know you want it.  To do this, Google would need several things, including geolocation as well as you personal preferences.  One example they provided is if Google know's you like Mexican food because you rated a restaurant highly in the past, then it could provide you several highly rated Mexican Restaurants in your area around lunch time.  It's about combining a person's context with their past opinions and actions, and the opinions and actions of others. To me, it sounds like an incredible, as well as easily attainable idea. However, there are some downsides.  To do this, Google would need to monitor your actions all day, every day. This poses a major privacy concern that many people would not be ok with.  </p>

			<h3>Internet Still Reshaping History</h3>
			<p align="left">This article, posted on the 40th aniversary of the internet, discussed the impacts its creation has had on society.  Along with the birth of the internet, there were several other things mentioned that had happened 40 years ago such as humans walking on the moon, the gay rights movement, and woodstock.  The author states that nothing has been more influential on our society as the internet has, and I agree with him.  He states that the internet has created a global society; people are no longer restricted to associating with others for geographical regions. Through the use of the internet we can have communities based on personal interests.  The article then discussed how the internet moved from academia into every day life. This was because there were businesses ready to fund the buildup of the infrastructure to take advantage of it. The article also discussed some of the negatives the internet has brought on, such as new crimes like identity theft, ddos attacks, and the ease of stalking. But with all these negatives, the internet has increased our social wellbeing, and I believe will only continue to get better in the future.</p>

			<h3>SPDY: Experimental Protocal</h3>
			<p align="left"> This article discusses an experimental web protocol called SPDY being developed by Google at Chromium Labs. The inspiration came to help reduce the latency of web pages, and Google found that SPDY was up to 64% faster in page load times over HTTP. There have been other potential solutions to web latency, mostly at the level of the transport or session layer, however, SPDY works on the application layer. The basic features include multiplexed streams, request prioritization, and HTTP header compression.  In addition, SPDY also has advanced features, such as server push and server hint. SPDY has shown great signs of potential speedup during tests, but Google isn't sure how well this reflects the real world. To help, Google suggests sending feedback to their team on the chromium-discuss page, to download, build and run the Google Chrome client code, and to also contribute improvements to their code base.
