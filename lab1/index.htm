			<h3>Google Agitates for Revolution</h3>
			<p align="left">This article discussed Web components and their future involvement in the web. Web components are a W3C standard designed to help organize complex Web pages by providing a mechanism to assemble them using small single-function components. The advantage of using web components is that it allows developers to compartmentalize their problems when creating web pages. The article then discussed Polymer, which is Google's library to use and extend web components. To take advantage of this technology, web developers can embbed all the libraries elements, and dependencies within a web component. Then while using the import html tag, the component can be used, and then reused again in the future. This also allows developers to use components written by others, promoting code reusability. </p>

			<h3>Man Who Wants to Translate Web</h3>
			<p align="left">This article discussed a new tool called Duolingo, created by Luis von Ahn and Severin Hacker.  The article states that 50% of the world's web pages are in English; this poses a problem for countries with a developing internet presence.  The goal of Duolingo is to tranlate every web page into every language. However, this is quite a daunting task both in the cost, as well as the sheer amount of people and time required to do this. To overcome this problem, Duolingo is taking advantage of people wanting to learn a new language. In this language training course, Duolingo has many individuals translate sentences from real web pages. It then takes the best translation, and uses that on its translated page. This way it ensures that it gets the best translation, as well as keeping the software to learn a new language 100% free. </p>
